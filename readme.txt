This Project started out as a school project which got abandoned (because lazy people). It is now being made into a proper Entity Component Engine.
I plan to make a Game at some point with this but before i actually need to finish it.
At its current Stage it has alot of groundlevel stuff like Models/Textures/NormalMaps/Script(ChaiScript)/Gui(used CEGUI)/Audio(Irrklang).
Its still in  a rather early age and needs to be more streamlined and the communication between system is still in the works.
